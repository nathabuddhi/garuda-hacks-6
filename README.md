# ♻️ LimbahKu

**LimbahKu** is a waste management platform that helps users repurpose valuable household waste by connecting them with verified waste buyers. From stacks of old paper to broken electronics and used plastic, our app ensures that your waste doesn't go to waste.

> A project built for **Garuda Hacks 6.0** by **The Labbers**.

## 🌱 What Is LimbahKu?

LimbahKu enables regular individuals to turn unused items into something meaningful. Whether it's:

- 📄 Paper from old school work
- ♻️ Plastic packaging waste
- 🥫 Cans and containers
- 💻 Broken electronics
- and more!

With just a few taps, users can request a pickup. Our app dispatches a driver, the items are delivered to a waste buyer, and users receive payment (minus the delivery cost).

This initiative promotes **sustainability**, **recycling awareness**, and **economic empowerment**—all in one streamlined experience.
